About ten years ago, one of the smartest, most brilliant writers I know died, leaving behind words that make me smile, think and just bow with respect for utter genius. This essay has been linked to quite a bit in the last few days, mostly because it so accurately describes the media's attitude towards the Internet. He wrote that in 1999, and (sadly) it's still true.
