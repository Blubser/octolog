Wow, Kickstarter is on fire lately. Here's an iOS game that looks ridiculously good, one that is not "casual" at all. I've been waiting for games like this to emerge on the iOS platform, and boy, I'm excited.

In other recent Kickstarter news: Ze Frank's has started to produce his new show (linked [here](http://lumenlog.com/post/a-show-with-ze-frank/)). Go ahead and watch the [first episode](http://ashow.zefrank.com/episode/86), it's great.
