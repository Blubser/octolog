A profile piece on the creator of Braid, Jonathan Blow. A fascinating person, with interesting plans and an incredibly negative view of the current state of video games. I don't fully agree with him, but in order to change something, you probably have to be hyper-aware of its failures. And he's trying to change an entire medium with his new game "The Witness".

> In a medium still awaiting its quantum intellectual leap, Blow aims to make The Witness a groundbreaking piece of interactive artâ€”a sort of Citizen Kane of video games.
