Everything about this essay by Robin Sloan is brilliant: The writing, the presentation, and the marketing.

**Writing**: "Fish" is a short, but thought-provoking essay on the relationship between liking and loving content on the web. Robin makes some great points on how to deal with the onslaught of interesting *stuff* the web keeps throwing at us. Definitely worth your time, and probably very suitable to being re-read from time to time.

**Presentation**: This is the fun part. This essay was not published on a blog, but in form of a little iPhone app. Even though I think that this shouldn't become a standard, I'll let this one pass. Because it's so damn beautiful and fun. It feels more like watching the slides of a talk than reading an essay. There are a few lines of text at most on every screen, sometimes just a word. And at some point, oddly enough, the picture of a fish. 

**Marketing**: The idea is slightly evil, but still brilliant: The most memorable lines of this essay have a Twitter button built right in. A few taps and you can tweet it, including a link to the essay, of course. Instant marketing, done in style. (You should totally found a company with that motto.)
