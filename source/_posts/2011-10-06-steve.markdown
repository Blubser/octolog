Steve

> An era has ended, and we now sit to reflect on our good fortune for having lived in a time when a true giant walked the Earth.

so eloquently says what I have been trying to put into words. We live in a truly amazing time, and some of its awesomeness is Steve's work. He has truly, undeniably changed the world we live in. He also was, and is, an inspiration. I am deeply grateful to have shared a planet with him.

[Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/11/10/remembering-steve-jobs) has collected some great stories, thoughts and videos on Steve. Do yourself a favor and read some, or at least watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA).

Thank you, Steve. ï£¿
