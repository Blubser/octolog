Pebble is an e-paper watch that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth. Even though I'm not entirely convinced that I really want a *watch* that displays notifications (a constantly vibrating iPhone in my pocket is distracting enough), I'm getting unhealthily excited about the potential of fully customisable watch faces.

(Also: Whoa, north of two *million* dollars raised on Kickstarted in about two days. People seem to *really* like that watch.)
