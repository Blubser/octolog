The nerdiest and probably best thing you're going to read today: An alternative order to watch all the Star Wars movies. Well, except episode I, which is left out of this order because it is kind of crappy. It's very well-argued too, and entirely readable just for the assorted Star Wars nerdery.

I so totally adore this idea. Now I just need to find some time to re-watch all of the movies. Again. In the right order this time.
