To complete my accidental mini-series on underwear (see: [socks](http://lumenlog.com/post/all-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-high-end-socks/)), I proudly present this Kickstarter (!) project that aims at producing high-quality cotton underwear. It's obviously rather on the expensive side, but 18â‚¬ for really good underpants is not entirely ridiculous either.

Kickstarter is awesome.
