Okay, I admit it: I'm a sucker for people taking something basically trivial a bit too seriously. So this article on premium socks is right up my alley. And man, those socks sound amazing:

> When I pulled them on, it was as though I’d dipped my feet into baths of warm butter. I have never worn anything more comfortable—on any part of my body.

The catch: They cost 200$ and can only be worn about six times. 

This weird interest in geeky stuff is also the reason why I'm currently struggling *not* to buy [this coffee maker](http://caffestreets.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/hario-coffee-syphon-technica-2-cup-tca-2).
