> The [New York City Municipal Archives](http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/gallery/home.shtml) just released a database of over 870,000 photos from its collection of more than 2.2 million images of New York throughout the 20th century. Their subjects include daily life, construction, crime, city business, aerial photographs, and more. I spent hours lost in these amazing photos, and gathered this group together to give you just a glimpse of what's been made available from this remarkable collection.

All of these are great, but number 29 is extraordinarily good. It's my new wallpaper.
