Kudos for writing the review I was to lazy to write. Apart from that, I also like his opening statement on eBooks in general:

> Because of these lacks in function and emotions, I tend to perceive eBooks as a convenience: you can buy them from your couch, they have no weight, and they don't age. You give away all the sexyness, presence and reliability of a nice paper book for accessibility and zero impact on your bookshelf.

That's kind of sad, but also true.
