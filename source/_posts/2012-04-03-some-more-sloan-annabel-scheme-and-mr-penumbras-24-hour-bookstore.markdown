To continue the Sloan love fest: You should totally read this novella too. It gets slightly weird towards the end, but the first half is a sweet Gibsonesque near-future detective story with some genuinely amazing ideas thrown in.

Also, this short story: [Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore](http://robinsloan.com/mr-penumbra/). Also has a strange ending, but the first 75% are pure awesome. Go make yourself a hot beverage of your liking, put on some nice music, and read for a bit.
