<blockquote>From a disparate set of information, you continually find your own arc, your own story, and my question is: What are you going to do with it?</blockquote>

<blockquote>You’ve got two things going for you. You’ve got the inexplicable moment of inspiration that created your idea, and it’s the closest thing to magic you’ll experience in your life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this digitally distant world full of information that appears to only be moving faster and faster, you get to choose: how much will I consume and how much will I create?</blockquote>

I love stories.
