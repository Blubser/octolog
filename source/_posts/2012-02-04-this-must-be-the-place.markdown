> THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a series of short films that explore the idea of home; what makes them, how they represent us, why we need them.

I just watched the most recent one about "The Prime Burger", a burger place in Manhattan that has been around for 74 years. The amazing camera work really captures the place. Eight minutes well spent.
